Makoto\"Ah~ I have finally arrived in this city."
Makoto\"Wow~ festival!"
Makoto\"Maybe I can look around first before going to Kei's Place."
Kei\"I knew it, you're Makoto."
Kei\"Long time no see."
Makoto\"...?"
Makoto\"Could you be Kei?"
Makoto\"You've gotten so tall that I couldn't tell."
Makoto\"Did you come to pick me up?"
Kei\"Yeah, you're terrible with directions."
Kei\"I figured you'd get lost in the way."
